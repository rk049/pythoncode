# Object Oriented Programming
# Objects: Instance of class
# Objects have method which can be accessed using dot operator.
# We can create our own class and objects and methods

# class : blueprint

class Oops:

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

 #Note:__init__ method is automatically called whenever an instance if class is created/ object is created

    def run(self):
        print('run')
# as run function is not returning anything so in output we will get none also

obj1 = Oops('Rohit')
print(obj1.name)
print(obj1.run())
